## Linux Host

This section show how to install a new Android image to ROCK960 on board eMMC using the [upgrade_tool](http://opensource.rock-chips.com/wiki_Upgradetool) on a Linux host computer.

***

- **Step 1**: Make sure upgrade_tool is set up on host computer
- **Step 2**: Download necessary Android images
- **Step 3**: Boot device into maskrom mode
- **Step 4**: Prepare the flash environment
- **Step 5**: Flash images onto ROCK960 eMMC and reboot

***

#### **Step 1**: Make sure upgrade_tool is set up on host computer

##### Linux

upgrade_tool is a closed source binary by Rockchip. It can be downloaded from [rockchip-linux github](https://github.com/rockchip-linux/tools/tree/rk3399/linux/Linux_Upgrade_Tool). The current version is v1.33. Download it.

Since upgrade_tool released by Rockchp is a 32bit binary, most of us run 64bit Linux machine, we need to install 32bit libraries to run it.

On Ubuntu 64bit, install the following package:

    sudo apt-get install libc6-i386

unzip the tar ball we downloaded

	unzip Linux_Upgrade_Tool_v1.33.zip
	cd Linux_Upgrade_Tool_v1.33

Use the configuration file

    mkdir -p $HOME/.config/upgrade_tool/
	cp config.ini $HOME/.config/upgrade_tool/
    sudo cp rkdeveloptool /usr/local/bin/

Test if upgrade_tool working properly

    sudo upgrade_tool -v

should return

    Upgrade Tool v1.33


#### **Step 2**: Prepare necessary Android images

Go to the [Downloads page](../downloads) to donwload the image or use your own built one. _update.img_ is the default name if you follow the build instructions of [AOSP](../build/aosp.md). We use the name _update.img_ to refer Rockchip format packed Android image.

It contains the following partitions:

```
.
├── boot.img (Android rootfs)
├── kernel.img (Kernel image with Rockchip checksum)
├── MiniLoaderAll.bin (first stage bootloader)
├── misc.img (boot command, boot recovery, wipe data etc)
├── parameter.txt
├── recovery.img
├── resource.img (kernel dtb with other boot resource files such as logo image)
├── system.img
├── trust.img
└── uboot.img

```

#### **Step 3**: Boot device into maskrom mode

[Maskrom mode](http://opensource.rock-chips.com/wiki_Rockusb#Maskrom_mode) is the code inside the Rockchip SoC running and waiting for commands from USB when there is no external bootable media. To put the device into maskrom mode:

- power on rock960
- plug the rock960 to Linux desktop with USB type A to type C cable
- press and hold the maskrom key, then short press reset key (alternatively, reboot the device to loader mode `adb reboot bootloader` then use the upgrade_tool to reset the device into maskrom mode `upgrade_tool rd 3`).

On the host PC, `lsusb` should show the following VID/PID if the board is in maskrom mode: `Bus 003 Device 061: ID 2207:0011`

**Note**: if no right USB device found, try:

1. Press and hold maskrom key longer, and short press and release reset key.

2. Check your usb cable, plug and unplug the usb cable, reverse plug the type C port and try.


#### **Step 5**: Flash images onto ROCK960 eMMC and reboot

To flash the _update.img_ to on board eMMC

	sudo upgrade_tool uf /path/to/update.img

This will take a while, after it finishes, upgrade_tool will reboot the device.

Flash by partitions

Flash kernel only:

	sudo upgrade_tool di -k kernel.img

Flash resource only:

	sudo upgrade_tool di -re kernel.img
